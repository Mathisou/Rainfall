There is a binary file

Try to execute it --> segfault
Then try giving an argument --> it works but we seem to not fill a condition

Lets disas the main using gdb

start with

```
r [arg]
```

We see a call to atoi and then a comparaison between the output of atoi and a value 

```
   0x08048ed4 <+20>:	call   0x8049710 <atoi>
=> 0x08048ed9 <+25>:	cmp    $0x1a7,%eax
```

Lets put a breakpoint on the cmp line

```
b *main+25
```

then compare the value of eax with 0x1a7

```
print $eax
--> XX
print 0x1a7
--> 423
```

Now try to execute the binary giving 423 as argument

Bingo it execute the shell with the level1 rights!
